# CIFAR-10-KNN
KNN (K-nearest neighbours) classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset
Apply 5-fold cross validation to find the best K and L (Euclidean of Manhattan distance) pair by plotting the resulting average accuracies and standard deviations and choosing the pair which has the highest average accuracy and lowest standard deviation. Use this pair to find the accuracy per class and average accuracy on the testing set. Find out if grayscalse would produce a better accuracy than colored.
